üìàProblem Statement:

In stock markets, buyers and sellers place orders at different prices and quantities. The challenge is to match BUY and SELL orders efficiently while respecting rules like:
1. Best price first (highest BUY price vs lowest SELL price).
2. Timestamp priority (first-come-first-serve if prices are the same).
3. Partial matching (if full order can‚Äôt be matched, match what‚Äôs possible).
Our system also supports searching through 1 million stock records efficiently using optimized data structures.

üí°Approach:

1. Order Matching: Implemented using priority queues where BUY orders are sorted by highest price (and earliest timestamp) and SELL orders by lowest price (and earliest timestamp).

2. Partial Matching: Remaining unmatched orders are stored back in the order book.

3. Stock Search: Implemented with Tries (for prefix search), Hash Maps (for direct access), and Trees (for price ordering).

4. Scalability: Designed to process thousands of orders per second.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/swetlakhani218/Stock-Order-Matching-System.git

    cd Stock-Order-Matching-System

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / any Java IDE.

3. Build the project using Maven.

   mvn clean install

4. Run the application:

   mvn spring-boot:run

üìã Prerequisites:

1. Java 17+
2. Spring Boot 3+
3. Maven installed
4. IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse/VS Code with Java plugin)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps to Run the Project

1. Start the Spring Boot server.

2. Use REST API endpoints to:

    Place BUY/SELL orders. 
    View order book.
    Search stocks by ID or name.
    Retrieve historical trades.

3. (Optional) Run unit tests:

    mvn test

üîç Explanation of Complex Logic

1. Order Matching Algorithm

    BUY orders ‚Üí Max-Heap (highest price first).
    SELL orders ‚Üí Min-Heap (lowest price first).
    Match when BUY price ‚â• SELL price.
    If quantities differ, partially match and keep the remainder in the book.

2. Stock Search

    Trie ‚Üí Fast prefix search by stock name.
    HashMap ‚Üí O(1) lookup by stock ID.
    Tree ‚Üí Keep sorted stock prices for efficient range queries.
